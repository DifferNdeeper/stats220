# What's going on with this data?
## Instagram Ads Survey Insights and Analysis. 
This dynamic report tracks survey responses from an Instagram ads survey. The survey asks respondents three questions:  
- **Which type of products or services are on Instagram ads?**  
- **How relevant are the products on ads to the personal interests?**  
- **How many times have you seen the same ads?**  

Dynamic summary values (calculated in a code chunk below) include:  
- **Minimum count**   
- **Maximum count**   
- **Total count**   
- **Number of records**     

The report dynamically calculates key summary values for the number of times respondents have seen the same ads and creates two bar charts:  
1. **One chart shows the frequency of responses for the type of the product ads**  
2. **The other chart shows the frequency of  counts**   


```{r}
pets <- c("cat", "dog", "turtle", "rabbit")
best_pet <- pets[1]

```

The best pet to have is a `r best_pet` of course!
