## Data Technologies

This is my *repo* for **STATS 220**. 

*Fun facts* about me (ordered):
1. My favourite pizza is **pepperoni**
2. I like running around my neighbourhood on the weekend.


A little about me (unordered):
* I am undertaking a degree in data science
* I am taking STATS 220 because I want to get some knowledge about data technologies.
* I am interested in learning about R and HTML.
